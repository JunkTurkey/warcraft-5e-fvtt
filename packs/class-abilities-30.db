{"name":"Spellcasting (Mage)","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane, you own a spellbook with spells that show the glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 of Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the mage spell list.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Cantrips</span></strong></h3><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.</p><blockquote><h3><br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Your Spellbook</span></strong></h3><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell re-corded on a scroll in an evil sorcerer's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book:</strong> When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong>: You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. The remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. Many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><strong>The Book's Appearance:</strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorations and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spellbook</span></strong></h3><p>You have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook does not contain your known cantrips.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></strong></h3><p>The Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.</p><p>You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p><p>You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your  Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example. if you're a 3rd-level mage, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spellcasting Ability</span></strong></h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll.</p><p></p><p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ritual Casting</span></strong></h3><p>You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spellcasting Focus</span></strong></h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</span></strong></h3><p>Each time you gain a mage level, you add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Mage table.
