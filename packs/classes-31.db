{"name":"Warrior (qwe)","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Now, watch them attack me. QWEPitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come to challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come?

Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. </p><p>The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel. Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.</p><p>Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span></strong></h3><p>Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on  protection their allies from mortal blows, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some prefer a single large weapon able to be wielded with extraordinary force. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Warrior</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane fighters around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self taught, unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a  way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. Or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions and the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook -

It is well known for being entropic and extremely chaotic, leading its practice to have been banned in most societies and for its practitioners to work in secrecy. Whilst other forms of magic have a natural source, from the wielder or granted to the wielder, fel magic is a bargain. It corrupts the minds of those involved and desecrates the land around them.

These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment’s notice. </p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Protectors of Balance</span></strong></h3><p>Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline. It’s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia. Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creatures and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Druid</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you are creating your druid character, consider the bond you have with the natural world around you. Perhaps you always found comfort in the beasts of the wilds and have spent long in the shape of an animal, imitating nature itself? Perhaps your home was ravaged by raiders and you looked to the forces of nature for aid in rebuilding what was lost, seeking to restore that which has been damaged? or perhaps you have been raised by the faithful of Elune and have embraced the goddess as your own. Maybe your character was born in the depths of the elven forests, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny. Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove? Or perhaps you become an adventurer to find your bond to nature elsewhere in the world.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook - Druid 3.0","identifier":"Druid","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"DqFt52pMpPLlupjh","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"1d8 + @mod","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"2Ws2H3J8XXOjeBsv","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.tLatyicaPS6EdSjJ","Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.hOv3B8sTZBsD3pBo"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Level 1 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"JuGkDLaI8EA5jUEo","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.7PJnPVrwXyiIRmi5","Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.KOSrbdS0LrXqwSBE"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Level 2 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"tTs0FdzryLn98geu","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.75ZXR9ehIbZlIOQr","Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.aa8TA2jSmFALGIig"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Level 3 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"SJZPynCbLjQH7i2C","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.W2mY6EkQx7ha5yvW"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"Level 4 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"gE6jED8O4gpmHItn","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.W2mY6EkQx7ha5yvW"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Level 8 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"t2mtIw7jZVpAaOv3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.W2mY6EkQx7ha5yvW"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":12,"title":"Level 12 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"yeZyNeZZ5428rcUG","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.W2mY6EkQx7ha5yvW"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":16,"title":"Level 16 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"pl6cnud5vhDsanwO","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.rVGJQQCNPsqgXeT3","Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.SBVOOGK67iqwdfSn"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Level 18 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"TkqRS2eXccUI5Dm6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.warcraft-5e.class-abilities-30.W2mY6EkQx7ha5yvW"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":19,"title":"Level 19 Class Features","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"VsLcnoeo67H2arqW","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"value":2},"7":{"value":3},"11":{"value":4},"15":{"value":5},"19":{"value":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Affinities Known","classRestriction":"primary"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ani","arc","ins","med","nat","prc","prf","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"img":"modules/warcraft-5e/images/Classes/Druid%20Crest%202.png","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.LLZ7xV7ZbgEuDcJE"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674117989673,"modifiedTime":1675034915293,"lastModifiedBy":"VF3blh8wj6EG7x9O"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"VF3blh8wj6EG7x9O":3},"_id":"K2WkeW136ACdPiVn"}

The vast majority of death knights were raised under the control of the Lich King and later broke their bonds of enslavement. Consider how this change has affected your character and their view of the world, do they show distance or interest in what happens around them? Think about what relations your character may have to their family, do they still exist? would they accept them as they are now, or would they shun and banish them for what they have become? Perhaps you were once a figure of importance, a leader to others or a soldier in an army. Think about how this destiny came to be, how you died and what stories it may tell. Think about the effects having been raised into undeath may have done to you, what transformation in personality might've occurred. What interests may have been lost from your previous life. Becoming a death knight is a reincarnation, one where you are trapped in your own body, with a new view of the world around you.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook -

The pandaren word for 'spirit', they use the energy of their inner spirit, that flows through every living body. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes, as they gain experience, their training and their mastery of chi gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p><p></p><h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Training and Asceticism</span></strong></span></h3><p>Small walled cloisters dot the world, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p><p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or other mortal or divine power. The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Monk</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Arc you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness chi, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft

Clutching a spear in his hands, he charges in with intense fury, a large bear running at his side, roaring as he engages, cutting down one enemy after another.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a night elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the blue dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Holding his hand high, a blood elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Thalassian, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</em></p><p></p><h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Inescapable Stalkers</span></strong></span></h3><p>From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksman drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.</p><p>The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.</p><p></p><h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Proud Rangers</span></strong></span></h3><p>The hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies. Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. Elven rangers are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost.</p><p></p><h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Hunter's Choice</span></strong></span></h3><p>Hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role of prey and predator, and also reject the druidic stance that we should observe rather than actively participants in the \"Great Hunt\".</p><p>They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Hunter</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the hunter's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain, perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds. Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook -

When their target passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome silently sneaks up behind a guard, lifting the key ring from the his belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</em> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A Simple Code</span></strong></h3><p>For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital  organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. Rogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike. With the rogue’s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow. Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike, then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Skill and Precision</span></strong></h3><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Rogue</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past, or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventurers, or some other desire or ideal? What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend, who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook -

They have come to be our friends because I invited them. It is a part of being a shaman. We have a bond with the things of the natural world, and strive always to work in harmony with them. Warlocks would term them spells, but we shamans simply term them calls. We ask, the powers we work with answer. Or not, as they will. I can call the snows, and wind, and lightning. The trees may bend to me when I ask. The rivers may flow where I ask them to.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>— Drek'Thar of the Frostwolf clan</strong></em></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>An orc clad in loose plates chained together stands atop a lonely peak, the winds picking up around him, rattling through the chains of his armor, before he releases a glistening bolt of lightning toward his enemies.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A gray haired dwarf slowly lumps his way across the battlefield, emptying a bottle of water into the earth as he walks, before lifting it from the soil, and gently waves it over the body of a wounded ally, soothing his grave wounds.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A human sprinting through the thicket, a pair of massive wolves of spectral vision running at his side. In the flash of a moment he howls as his body turns into a wolf of similar visage to his pets.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Shamans are mortal mediators between the elements themselves. Often a spiritual guide in their community, these mystical figures may commune with ancestral spirits and weave elemental powers into their spells. Both to strengthen and heal their allies, and to strike down on the battlefield with devestating force. Shamans can imbue their weapons with the elements, smite their enemies with storm and fire, and summon forth elementals to their aid.</p><p></p><h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Herald of the Elements</span></strong></span></h3><p>A shaman's bond to their magic is unique. While a mage would study it in great depth, and a warlock would bend those same power to their whim, a shaman calls upon the elements themselves for aid. They commune with forces not strictly benevolent - sometimes they may respond, and sometimes they may choose not to. The elements are chaotic, chained away in their elemental plane as they rage against one another with unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos.</p><p>These masters of the elements can also call upon elemental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. An experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile adventurers and valued members of any group.</p><p></p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Respected and Feared</span></strong> </h3><p>Since the early days of mortal life both Azeroth and Draenor, the elements of have been both feared and worshiped. Mystics have sought to commune with them, to tap into the raw power of earth, air, fire, and water. In time, these spiritual guides have come to understand that the depth and gravity of the powers they wield. That the elements are not wholly benevolent, but rather a torrent of never ending conflict, as the elemental lord vie for control. The calling of the shaman is as a conduit of these volatile energies, leveraging them both to heal and to harm. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Shaman</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">When creating a shaman, consider how your bond with the elements have affected your personality and your view of the world. Although shamans resonate with all four primary elements, some tend to outwardly display aspects of one over the rest. Shamans who lean towards fire might be impatient, temperamental, or bursting with energy in all they do. Shamans who lean toward water are adaptable, chaotic, and tend to go with the flow. Those who favor earth are typically lawful, stalwart, and stubborn. And shaman who favor air are often aloof, distant, and the most neutral in their arbitrations. Think about your bond with your totems and how they represent the elemental planes from which you gain your power. Are they simply tools to you for channeling raw planar power, or are they sacred and worthy of reverence? Do they act as representations of a favored element, or do you use them to keep that element in check? How a shaman perceives their connection to the elemental planes is often reflected in the totems they summon forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook - Shaman

At the very core of becoming a demon hunter is the consumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Creating a Demon Hunter</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">As you make your demon hunter character, consider why your character decided to undergo the deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the Burning Legion? Did you strive for greater power through fel and how to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? Perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Warcraft Heroes Handbook - Demon Hunter
